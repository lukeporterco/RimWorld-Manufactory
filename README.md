# RimWorld Manufactory

## Mod Idea

*Manufactory* is a Rimworld 1.6 mod designed to fit seamlessly into the vanilla workflow.

The usual vanilla Crashland start goes something like:
Logistics Setup → Shelter → Food → Power → Research → Defense → Stability → Expansion

I'm making *Manufactory* to fill in that fuzzy area between Defense and Stability, and it also contains (or will eventually contain) lots of content for the expansion phase.

Where *Manufactory* might fit into the Crashlanded start:
Logistics Setup → Shelter → Food → Power → Research → Defense → Stability → ***Manufactory*** → Expansion

The current factory/production mods in RimWorld seem unbalanced and kinda broken. I'll do my best to make this mode as vanilla-balanced without just piling up more things to worry about in the already-overflowing RimWorld task list.

## Status: 
Early development. Like, **VERY** early.

## Major Progress So Far
- Curing System implemented and made more efficient
- Working Concrete Mixer added
- Finally starting to use "git push" less often (still might overload the history tho)
- Concrete Wall Textured added
- Paved Tile and Concrete added

## What Needs Work
- Making textures is lowk hard and takes a really long time, even when I have Inspired Creativity
- Compatibility with other mods

## Note
I am using OpenAI Codex to assist with the creation of this mod. I occasionally use AI Image Gen for inspiration, but I specifically avoid putting AI-made "textures" straight into the mod, because I don't want a soullesss mod filled with soulless AI slop.
