# RimWorld Manufactory

A modular factory and automation expansion for RimWorld 1.6.

Status: Early development. (Like, I just learned GitHub yesterday. Don't even know how to program yet. Am I cooked?)

Note: I'm relying on AI code for this project (don't judge). If anything seems wrong it's either because I don't have the knowledge to fix AI code or the AI just formatted something funny.
